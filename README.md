# What is this?

This is a proof of concept I'm putting together to answer the common question in any programming community. Is **this thing** better than **that thing**?

The Lucky core team will always answer this question with "It depends on what you want to do", since we see every language and framework as having benefits and drawbacks. We will **never** trash talk another framework or language, and this website is meant to highlight the things that make each of them great.

Will this ever be a site you can visit? Maybe! I'm still figuring that part out!
